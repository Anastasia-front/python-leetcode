# You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

# You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.

# Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

# Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.

# Note: The variables that do not occur in the list of equations are undefined, so the answer cannot be determined for them.


# Example 1:

# Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
# Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
# Explanation:
# Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
# queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
# return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
# note: x is undefined => -1.0
# Example 2:

# Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
# Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
# Example 3:

# Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
# Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]


# Constraints:

# 1 <= equations.length <= 20
# equations[i].length == 2
# 1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5
# values.length == equations.length
# 0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0
# 1 <= queries.length <= 20
# queries[i].length == 2
# 1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5
# Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj consist of lower case English letters and digits.
